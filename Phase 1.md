# Phase 1: an intuitive interface, that will document our CPE

In Netbox, there is a section for custom scripts. You provide what type of variable will be stored in the database, and Netbox handles the GUI. We know what our variables are, so letâ€™s write the code for the installers to enter them.

*Periods denote code that has been removed from the example and not explained in this document


```python
...
    RACK_MOUNT_ID = DeviceType.objects.get(model="RB2011-RM").id
    WALL_MOUNT_ID = DeviceType.objects.get(model="RB2011").id
    SITE_ID = Site.objects.get(name="Customer Premise").id
    DEVICE_ROLE_ID = DeviceRole.objects.get(name="CPE").id
    CHOICES = (
        (RACK_MOUNT_ID,"Rack Mount"),
        (WALL_MOUNT_ID,"Wall Mount")
    )
...
    business_name = StringVar(label="Business Name")
    hardware_choice = ChoiceVar(choices=CHOICES)
    comments = TextVar(label="Comments", required=False)
```

 The above code, coupled with the required Netbox boiler plate, will give the installer a simple interface like so.

The user can enter data, but now we need to create the device and save it to the database and test it.

```python
...
    device = Device(
        name=data['business_name'],
        device_role_id=self.DEVICE_ROLE_ID,
        device_type_id=data["hardware_choice"],
        site_id=self.SITE_ID
    )
    device.save()
...
```
